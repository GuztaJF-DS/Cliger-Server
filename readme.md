# About

The Cliger is a management application for micro, small, and medium companies, the idea behind the Cliger would be to help these entrepreneurs to plan better since in Brazil most companies close in less than a year because of stupid decisions and a really bad administration.<br>
But how will the cliger help me, you ask me, well we will expose numbers, data, graphs, predictions among other things that most of these small entrepreneurs don't even know about the existence<br>
Lastly, it is necessary to say that this is only the first part of the project, the server, after that first step we will work on the Mobile version and then if time helps with a little thing for the desktop
